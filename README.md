# minesweeper-ag
This is my first project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. I'm building a version of Minesweeper. Minesweeper is a classic logic game with ties to early computer logic puzzle games of the 1960s. It was popularized in its current form when it was included in Windows by default in the early 1990s.

You can access a working version of the game here: https://adamhg2411.github.io/minesweeper-ag

To play, click any square in the grid. You should see one of three things:
* an empty grey square
* a number from 1 - 8
* a mine/bomb

If you see an empty square or a number, that indicates the number of mines adjacent to that square (including diagonals). Your goal is to mark the locations of each mine without revealing them.

In the classic version, you marked mines by right-clicking, but that action isn't standardized across browsers. To switch between revealing squares and placing mine markers, click the toggle below the grid. An arrow should point to the option that is currently selected.
